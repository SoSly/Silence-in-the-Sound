title: Silence in the Sound

The rules on this website are considered a "Hack" for the [Fate Core](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/) system. Rules listed here always supersede those found on the SRD.  If a rule is not covered here, it should be assumed that the rules in the SRD are to be used.

However, this is not a game where lawyering the rules is encouraged. Instead, players are encouraged to simply **play** their character and immersive themselves in the story. The rules can be learned in play!  

That said, there are a few pieces of key terminology which need to be understood before play begins, and those are laid out, here.

## The Basics
Silence in the Sound is a roleplaying game set in Thurston County, Washington during the year 2026. On the surface, it's a place of serene natural beauty and bustling urban life. But beneath this facade lies a world of dark wonders and supernatural intrigue. Characters begin play as regular, everyday people, but will quickly become immersed in a hidden reality they never knew existed.

The game's atmosphere is one of mystery and adventure as players uncover the truth. Ancient legends come to life, urban myths prove all too real, and the line between the mundane and the magical blurs. Vampires prowl the night, werewolves lurk in the forests, and other fantastical beings walk among us, hidden in plain sight. Your characters will discover these secrets and more importantly, they'll have the power to do something about it. 

As you're drawn deeper into this world of dark fantasy, you'll face challenges that will test your courage, your wits, and your humanity. But remember, in Silence in the Sound, you're not just observers - you're the heroes of the story. With knowledge comes power, and as you uncover the truth, you'll gain the ability to shape this hidden world. The question is: how will you use that power?

### Important Terminology
The following terms are important to understanding how to play a Fate game. Players must be familiar with these terms in order to begin play:

- An **aspect** is a phrase that describes something unique or noteworthy about whatever it's attached to. You will create and use aspects regularly while playing this game. The SRD has more information about the [Types of Aspects](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/types-aspects).
- **Fate Points** are a resource that measures how much influence you have.  The SRD can teach you more about the [Fate Point Economy](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/fate-point-economy).
- A **skill** is a verb completing the phrase "I am going to ...", and describes a broad family of competency at something--such as Drive, Deceive, or Provoke--which your character might have gained through innate talent, training, or years of trial and error.
- A **stunt** is a special trait your character has that changes the way a skill works for you.
- The **ladder** is a list of adjectives and numbers which are used to rate the dice results, skill levels, and results of a roll. See [The Ladder](ladder).
- **Stress** determines how much of a beating your character can take. You mark a stress box when bad things happen to your character, and if you cannot mark off a stress box, you instead must take a **consequence**. See [Stress & Consequences](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/stress-consequences) on the SRD. You can also read more about how [stress is used in the sound](stress).

## Character Creation
You will begin by defining who your character **is**.  This is their name, ethnicity, gender, and a bit of their backstory, as well as their `High Concept` and their `Trouble`.

For more information, learn about the Fate Core SRD can help you to come up with [Your Character Idea](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/your-character-idea).

### Character Creation is Play
Once you have defined your character's High Concept and Trouble, you're ready to begin play!  However, your character is not yet fully formed. 

During the course of play, you will assign your other aspects, as well as your character's skills and stunts.

#### Additional Aspects
Three times during play you can create a new permanent Aspect for your character.  For example, while dealing with politics on Capital Hill, you might decide that your character is the `Son of a Senator`. 

#### Skills
Even though they aren't defined, your skills form a pyramid, with a single skill rated at Great (+4) and more skills at each lower rating on the ladder going down to Average (+1):
- One Great (+4) skill
- Two Good (+3) skills
- Three Fair (+2) skills
- Four Average (+1) skills

The first time you roll a skill during the game, you can choose to apply one of these ratings to that skill.  Once you have applied a rating to a skill, it cannot be changed to a lower rating (although you may choose to swap it for a higher rating, in the future).

For example, if you're trying to sneak past a guard and haven't yet assigned a rating to your Sneak skill, you could choose to make it your Great (+4) skill at that moment.

See the [Skill List](skills) for the list of skills in the game.

#### Stunts
Three times during play you can create or declare a new Stunt that your character knows.  For example, if your character is attacked in an alley, you can declare that you always have your `Ear to the Ground` to roll your [Network](/skills/network) instead of your [Notice](/skills/notice) to determine who goes first in the conflict.

#### Extras
As the story advances, your character may be able to purchase **extras**. Extras are magic and supernatural powers, specialized gear or equipment, vehicles or companions, or organizations or locations that your character has a great deal of influence in. Extras are typically introduced later in the game as characters discover more about the supernatural world.

For example, if you are `Bitten by a Werewolf` the GM may allow you to spend your refresh on extras related to your lycanthropy.  Or perhaps your character takes the time to trick out their car with bulletproof glass and a killer suspension system.
