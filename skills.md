# Skills & Stunts
A **skill** is a verb which completes the sentence "I would like to <verb>", such as [charm](./skills/charm.md), [drive](./skills/drive.md), or [notice](./skills/notice.md).  Your character might have gained their competency in a skill through innate talent, training, or years of trail and error.  Skills are the basis for everything your character actually does in the game that involves challenge and chacne (and dice).

Skills are rated on the adjective [ladder](/ladder.md). The higher the rating, the better your character is at the skill. Taken together, your list of skills gives you a picture of that character's potential for action at a glance--what you're best at, what you're okay at, and what you're not so good at.

We define skills in two ways in Fate--in terms of the game actions that you can do with them, and the context in which you can use them. There are only a handful of basic game actions, but the number of potential contexts is infinite.

## The Basic Game Actions
Every skill comes with a definition and examples of how it can be used to accomplish the four basic game actions.

| <!-- --> | <!-- -->
| <span class="fate-font big">O</span> | **Overcome:** True to its name, you tackle some kind of challenge, engaging task, or hindrance related to your skill.
| <span class="fate-font big">C</span> | **Create an Advantage:** Whether you’re discovering something that already exists about an opponent or creating a situation that helps you succeed, creating advantages allows you to discover and create aspects, and lets you get free invocations of them.
| <span class="fate-font big">A</span> | **Attack:** You try to harm someone in a conflict. That harm may be physical, mental, emotional, social, or magical in nature.
| <span class="fate-font big">D</span> | **Defend:** You try to keep someone from harming you, getting past you, or creating an advantage to use against you.

There are also some special effects that some skills perform, such as giving you additional [stress](/stress.md) boxes for a conflict.  See [endure](./skills/endure.md) for an example.

Even though there are only four actions that all skills adhere to, the skill in question lends context to the action. For example, both Steal and Craft allow you to create an advantage, but only under very different contexts--Steal allows you to do it when you’re casing a place you’re about to break into, and Craft allows you to do it when you’re examining a piece of machinery. The different skills let you differentiate the PCs’ abilities from one another a bit, allowing each person to have a unique contribution to the game.
