## Charm
The Charm skill is all about making positive connections to people and eliciting positive emotion. It’s the skill of being liked and trusted.

<span class="fate-font big">O</span> **Overcome:** Use Charm to build rapport or inspire people to do what you want, or to establish a good connection with them. Talk your way past the guard, convince someone to take you into their confidence, or become the man of the hour at the local tavern. For nameless NPCs, this is just an overcome action, but you may have to enter a contest to sufficiently ingratiate yourself to a named NPC or PC.

<span class="fate-font big">C</span> **Create an Advantage:** Use Charm to establish a positive mood on a target or in a scene or to get someone to confide in you out of a genuine sense of trust. You could pep talk someone into having `Elevated Confidence`, or stir a crowd into a `Joyful Fervor`, or simply make someone `Talkative` or `Helpful`.

<span class="fate-font big">A</span> **Attack:** Use Charm to wear down someone's resolve through positive social pressure. This could involve swaying an audience against them, making them want to please you to their own detriment, or using your likeability to extract information they'd rather not share.

<span class="fate-font big">D</span> **Defend:** Use Charm to deflect social attacks by maintaining a likeable demeanor. This can defend against intimidation attempts, discrediting efforts, or attempts to read your true intentions when you're trying to keep them hidden behind a genuinely charming facade.

### Charm Stunts
- **Best Foot Forward.** Twice per session, you may upgrade a boost you receive with Charm into a full situation aspect with a free invocation.
- **Demagogue.** +2 to Charm when you’re delivering an inspiring speech in front of a crowd. (If there are named NPCs or PCs in the scene, you may target them all simultaneously with one roll rather than dividing up your shifts.)
- **Popular.** If you’re in an area where you’re popular and well-liked, you can use Charm in place of Network. You may be able to establish your popularity by spending a fate point to declare a story detail, or because of prior justification.
