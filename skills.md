### Creating Skills
This skill list is designed to reinforce the gameplay for **Silence in the Sound**; however, it is possible for some characters to have niche or novel skills not represented here. If you believe your character qualifies for a unique skill, work with your **Game Master** to define that skill and have it added to your sheet.

## Stunts
Each skill definition includes a list of example stunts which may be used with that skill.  These stunts are not exhaustive, and players are encouraged to design unique stunts for their characters.  You must have at least an Average (+1) rating in a skill to have a stunt for that skill.
