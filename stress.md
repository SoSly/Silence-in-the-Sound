title: Stress & Consequences
---

## Stress Tracks
Every character has two combat stress tracks:
- The **physical** stress track is based on the [Endure](skills/endure) skill, and deals with bodily harm and injury
- The **mental** stress track is based on the [Resolve](skills/resolve) skill, and deals with emotional and psychological harm

In addition to these stress tracks, characters may have additional stress tracks.

### Wealth
Rather than using a skill to track purchasing power, characters are assumed to have enough money to get by day-to-day.  However, in order to make a large purchase or bribe someone, characters may take an appropriate wealth-based consequence.  Characters with an Aspect related to wealth, such as `Filthy Rich`, `Trust Fund Baby`, or `Corporate Executive` gain an additional **Wealth** track which can be stressed before consequences are required. The length of this track is equal to the number of permanent wealth-based aspects on the character's sheet.

Wealth stress does not recover at the end of a combat. Instead, at the end of each scenario you can remove 1 point of stress from your wealth track.
