## Network
Network is the skill of knowing and making connections with people. It presumes proficiency with all means of networking available in the setting.

<span class="fate-font big">O</span> **Overcome:** You use Network to overcome any obstacle related to finding someone you need to find. Whether that’s old-fashioned “man on the street” type of work, polling your informants, or searching archives and computer databases, you’re able to hunt down people or somehow get access to them.

<span class="fate-font big">C</span> **Create an Advantage:** Network allows you to know who the perfect person to talk to is for anything you might need, or to decide that you know the perfect person already. It’s likely that you’ll create story details with this skill, represented by aspects. (“Hey, guys, my contacts tell me that Joe Steel is the `Best Mechanic For A Thousand Miles`--we should talk to him.”)

You can also create an advantage that represents what the word on the street is about a particular individual, object, or location, based on what your network tells you. These aspects almost always deal with reputation more than fact, such as `Known as a Mean Guy` or `Notorious Swindler`. Whether that person lives up to their reputation is anybody’s guess, though that doesn’t invalidate the aspect--people often have misleading reputations that complicate their lives.

Network could also be used to create aspects that represent using your informants to plant or acquire information.

<span class="fate-font big">A</span> **Attack:** Network isn't used for attacks; it's hard to harm someone simply by knowing people.

<span class="fate-font big">D</span> **Defend:** Network can be used to defend against people creating social advantages against you, provided your informants can be brought to bear in the situation. You might also use it to keep someone from using [Deceive](deceive) or Network to go `off the grid`, or to interfere with [Investigate](investigate) attempts to find you.

### Network Stunts
- **Ear to the Ground.** Whenever someone initiates a conflict against you in an area where you’ve built a network of contacts, you use Network instead of [Notice](notice) to determine turn order, because you got tipped off in time.
- **Rumormonger.** +2 to create an advantage when you plant vicious rumors about someone else.
- **The Weight of Reputation.** You can use Network instead of [Provoke](provoke) to create advantages based on the fear generated by the sinister reputation you’ve cultivated for yourself and all the shady associates you have. You should have an appropriate aspect to pair with this stunt.
