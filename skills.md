# Skills & Stunts
A **skill** is a verb which completes the sentence "I would like to <verb>", such as [charm](skills/charm.md), [drive](skills/drive.md), or [notice](skills/notice.md).  Your character might have gained their competency in a skill through innate talent, training, or years of trail and error.  Skills are the basis for everything your character actually does in the game that involves challenge and chacne (and dice).

Skills are rated on the adjective [ladder](ladder.md). The higher the rating, the better your character is at the skill. Taken together, your list of skills gives you a picture of that character's potential for action at a glance--what you're best at, what you're okay at, and what you're not so good at.

We define skills in two ways in Fate--in terms of the game actions that you can do with them, and the context in which you can use them. There are only a handful of basic game actions, but the number of potential contexts is infinite.

## The Basic Game Actions
Every skill comes with a definition and examples of how it can be used to accomplish the four basic game actions.
